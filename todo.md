List of things to impelment:

- set new fields in objects
- support for comments within the parser
- comprehensive cli interface
- while should accept logic! or integer! (as it's documentation states)
- operations on series are implemented using switch, but this should be dynamic dispatch based on type
- all series functions should work on ALL series datatypes (blocks, strings, ports etc.)
