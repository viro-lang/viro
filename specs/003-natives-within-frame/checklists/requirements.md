# Specification Quality Checklist: Natives Within Frame

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: 
- ✅ No Go-specific or implementation details mentioned
- ✅ Focused on developer experience and language consistency
- ✅ Written in user-facing language (developers as users)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ No clarification markers found
- ✅ All FRs are testable (e.g., "eliminate native.Registry" can be verified by code inspection)
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable outcomes (test pass rates, code inspection results)
- ✅ No technology-specific details in success criteria
- ✅ Three comprehensive user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- ✅ Five edge cases identified covering initialization, mutation, closures, and conflicts
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to word resolution and native function storage
- ✅ Implicit assumptions documented in edge cases and requirements

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ Three prioritized user scenarios covering basic use (P1), advanced use (P2), and consistency (P1)
- ✅ Five success criteria align with measurable outcomes
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction from implementation
