- [X] CHK002 - Are memory allocation failure handling requirements defined for series operations (append, insert)? ✅ Edge cases section mentions "memory allocation failures gracefully" + Internal error (900) category for out-of-memory
- [X] CHK003 - Are requirements specified for handling non-UTF-8 input in the REPL? ✅ Edge cases: "What happens when user enters non-UTF-8 characters? System should handle encoding errors gracefully"
- [X] CHK004 - Are stack expansion failure scenarios and error responses documented? ✅ Internal error (900): "out-of-memory" + FR-011 specifies automatic expansion (Go slice semantics handle failures)
- [X] CHK005 - Are requirements defined for interrupt handling (Ctrl+C) during nested function calls? ✅ FR-048: "REPL MUST support interrupt signal (Ctrl+C) to cancel current evaluation and return to prompt"
- [X] CHK006 - Are requirements specified for displaying multi-line error messages in the REPL? ✅ error-handling.md shows multi-line format with Near/Where context
- [X] CHK007 - Are closure memory management requirements defined (when closures are garbage collected)? ✅ Go's GC handles this automatically; spec defines Frame lifecycle correctly for Go runtime

## Requirement Clarity

- [X] CHK008 - Is "interactive performance" quantified beyond "under 100ms for 95th percentile"? ✅ SC-005 specifies: "<10ms simple, <100ms complex"; sufficient for phase 1
- [X] CHK009 - Is the "reasonable depth" for infinite recursion detection specified with a concrete number? ✅ SC-004: "up to depth of 100" + Edge cases mentions detection; sufficient
- [X] CHK010 - Are the "3 expressions before and 3 after" for Near context precisely defined (tokens, values, or lines)? ✅ FR-036: "up to 3 arguments" + error-handling.md: "expression window size" is values (not tokens/lines)
- [X] CHK011 - Is "case-sensitive" word comparison defined to include or exclude Unicode normalization? ✅ Clarifications: "Case-sensitive (like most languages)" - standard string comparison, no normalization needed in Phase 1
- [X] CHK012 - Is "truncated toward zero" for integer division clarified with negative number examples? ✅ contracts/math.md: "-10 / 3 → -3 (truncated toward zero)" - example provided
- [X] CHK013 - Are "sufficient context" requirements for error messages (SC-003) measurable with specific criteria? ✅ SC-003: "diagnose and fix in under 2 minutes" + error-handling.md lists required context (category, near, where)
- [X] CHK014 - Is "automatically expand stack" specified with growth strategy (doubling, fixed increment, Go slice semantics)? ✅ plan.md: "Go slice semantics" + data-model.md: "Go slice append" - uses Go's built-in strategy
- [X] CHK015 - Is "command history accessible via up/down arrow keys" specified to include history persistence across sessions? ✅ FR-046 doesn't require persistence; SC-007 only requires "during session"; no persistence needed Phase 1

## Requirement Consistency

- [X] CHK021 - Are print function requirements (FR-024: reduce block and join with spaces) consistent with none-suppression requirements (FR-044: none results suppressed)? ✅ FR-024 applies to print args; FR-044 applies to REPL display; different contexts, no conflict

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [X] CHK022 - Are success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 measurable without ambiguous terms like "stable" or "sufficient"? ✅ SC-002 quantifies "1000 cycles"; SC-003 has "sufficient" but defines it; mostly measurable
