## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification avoids implementation details. References to "Viro semantics", "type-based dispatch", and "frame system" describe behavioral requirements, not implementation choices. The spec appropriately references the design document for architectural context without prescribing specific code structure.

✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user value: interactive REPL experience, expression evaluation, error handling that keeps REPL usable. Business need is clear: working interpreter foundation.

✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. User stories describe concrete interactions ("user enters `x: 10`", "system displays `10`"). Technical terms (frames, stack) are defined in Key Entities section with plain language descriptions.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing (6 prioritized stories), Requirements (50 functional requirements), Success Criteria (10 measurable outcomes), plus Assumptions and Out of Scope sections.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable. Each FR includes specific behavior (e.g., "FR-017: System MUST provide `if` function: `if condition [block]` - executes block if condition is true"). Acceptance scenarios provide test cases.

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: "at least 20 different expression types"
- SC-002: "1000 evaluation cycles without memory leaks"
- SC-005: "under 10 milliseconds" / "under 100 milliseconds"
- SC-007: "at least 100 previous commands"

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic. They describe user-observable outcomes ("Users can evaluate...", "REPL session remains stable...", "Error messages include sufficient context...") without mentioning Go, specific libraries, or implementation approaches.

✅ **PASS** - All acceptance scenarios defined. Each of 6 user stories includes 4-6 Given-When-Then scenarios totaling 28 acceptance tests.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified: deeply nested expressions, recursive functions without base case, mixed types, literal modification attempts, non-UTF-8 characters, long evaluations, memory consumption.

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded. Functional requirements specify exactly what's included (50+ native functions with signatures). "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 17 deferred features (Parse dialect, Module system, File I/O, etc.).

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies and assumptions documented. Assumptions section lists 12 items covering platform (macOS), Go version (1.21+), encoding (UTF-8), memory model, performance baseline, arithmetic precision, native function count, and REPL libraries.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios. User Story 1 (basic expressions) validated by FR-001 through FR-008 (evaluation, type system). User Story 2 (control flow) validated by FR-017 through FR-020. Each requirement has corresponding test scenario.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover primary flows in priority order:
- P1: Basic expression evaluation (foundation)
- P2: Control flow (programming logic)
- P3: Series operations (composite data)
- P4: Function definition (abstraction)
- P5: Error handling (robustness)
- P6: REPL features (usability)

✅ **PASS** - Feature meets measurable outcomes. Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 directly correspond to user stories. SC-001 validates expression evaluation (US1-US3), SC-004 validates function calls (US4), SC-003/SC-010 validate error handling (US5), SC-007/SC-008 validate REPL features (US6).

✅ **PASS** - No implementation leaks detected. Specification describes WHAT (REPL accepts input, evaluates expressions, displays results) and WHY (interactive programming, immediate feedback, error recovery) without prescribing HOW (no Go code, no library choices, no data structure implementations).

## Overall Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and appropriately scoped. No clarifications needed. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` command.

## Notes

- Specification appropriately references the design document (`docs/interpreter.md`) for architectural guidance without creating implementation dependencies.
- The layered approach (6 prioritized user stories) aligns with constitution principle II (Incremental Implementation by Architecture Layer).
- TDD approach is implicit in acceptance scenarios but should be made explicit during planning phase per constitution principle I.
- Assumptions section provides reasonable defaults (Go 1.21+, UTF-8, 64-bit integers) that eliminate need for clarifications while maintaining flexibility.
