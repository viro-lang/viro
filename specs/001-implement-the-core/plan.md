# Implementation Plan: Viro Core Language and REPL

**Branch**: `001-implement-the-core` | **Date**: 2025-01-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-implement-the-core/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a REBOL R3-inspired interpreter in Go with a working REPL. The core requirement is to create a type-based dispatch system that evaluates REBOL expressions (literals, words, functions, blocks) following strict TDD methodology. The implementation follows a layered architecture: Core Evaluator → Type System → Native Functions (~50 initially) → Frame/Context System → Error Handling → REPL Interface. This phase establishes the foundational architecture for the interpreter, supporting basic expressions, control flow, series operations, user-defined functions, and interactive REPL features with command history.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (requires generics and improved error handling)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Go standard library + github.com/chzyer/readline (REPL command history and multi-line input)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory interpreter state only)  
**Testing**: Go standard library `testing` package with table-driven test pattern (subtests via t.Run())  
**Target Platform**: macOS primary, Linux/Windows compatible (cross-platform Go)  
**Project Type**: Single CLI application (interpreter + REPL)  
**Performance Goals**: Stack ops <100ns, simple eval <10ms, complex eval <100ms per spec SC-005, tracked via Go benchmarks  
**Constraints**: Interactive response time <100ms for 95th percentile operations, stack depth 100+ function calls, command history 100+ entries, supports 10,000 values in memory simultaneously  
**Scale/Scope**: ~28 native functions initially (expanding to 600+ long-term), 8 core value types, 7 error categories, 1000+ REPL evaluation cycles without leaks

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **Principle I - TDD (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Planning includes Phase 1 contract definitions before implementation. Task breakdown will enforce test-first ordering.

✅ **Principle II - Incremental Layering**: Plan follows exact architecture sequence from constitution: Core Evaluator → Type System → Minimal Natives → Frame/Context → Error Handling → Extended Natives → Parse (deferred).

✅ **Principle III - Type Dispatch Fidelity**: Data model will define type-based dispatch with evaluation type maps. Each value type gets appropriate evaluation handler.

✅ **Principle IV - Stack and Frame Safety**: Stack design mandates index-based access (not pointers). Frame layout specified in contracts with return slot, prior frame, metadata, arguments.

✅ **Principle V - Structured Errors**: Spec defines 7 error categories (0-900 range) with required fields (code, type, id, arg1-3, near, where). Error contracts will enforce structure.

✅ **Principle VI - Observable Behavior**: REPL provides text I/O for evaluation results and errors. Error messages include context per FR-036. Trace capabilities deferred to later phase per clarification.

✅ **Principle VII - YAGNI**: Spec explicitly limits to ~50 native functions (FR-017 through FR-034). Parse dialect, module system, advanced features marked out-of-scope.

**Gate Status**: ✅ PASSED - All constitutional requirements satisfied by specification and planned architecture.

**Structure Decision**: Single project layout selected. This is a standalone CLI interpreter, not a web application or mobile app. The internal/ directory contains implementation packages not intended for external import. The pkg/viro/ directory is reserved for future embedding API if needed. Testing follows Go conventions with _test.go files and separate contract/integration test organization.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations detected. All constitutional principles are satisfied by the current plan.

## Phase 0: Research (Complete)

✅ **Completed**: All technical unknowns resolved

**Research Artifacts**:
- `research.md`: Comprehensive research covering 6 areas:
  1. REPL readline library selection (chzyer/readline chosen)
  2. Table-driven testing patterns (Go subtests with t.Run())
  3. Stack expansion strategy (Go slices with index-based access)
  4. Error context capture (Near: expression window, Where: call stack)
  5. UTF-8 string handling ([]rune for character series semantics)
  6. Interpreter benchmarking strategy (Go benchmarks with CI tracking)

**Decisions Made**:
- Primary dependency: github.com/chzyer/readline (pure Go, cross-platform)
- Testing approach: Go table-driven tests with subtests
- Performance targets: Stack ops <100ns, simple eval <10ms, complex eval <100ms
- **Local-by-default scoping**: Viro diverges from REBOL's global-by-default semantics. All words in function bodies are local by default, preventing accidental modification of global state. This design is safer and more predictable than REBOL's approach, aligning with modern language best practices (JavaScript let/const, Python local variables, etc.).
- **Bash-style refinements**: Viro replaces REBOL's `/refinement` syntax with bash-style `--flag` and `--option []` syntax. This makes function calls more intuitive and self-documenting: it's immediately clear which refinements are boolean flags vs which accept values. The syntax is familiar to CLI users and eliminates confusion about refinement argument order. Example: `copy data --deep --limit 5` is clearer than `copy/deep/limit data 5`.
- **Simplified control flow**: Viro replaces REBOL's confusing if/either distinction with a clearer when/if pair. `when condition [block]` executes a single branch (returns none if condition is false), while `if condition [true-block] [false-block]` requires both branches (like most mainstream languages). This eliminates the "why are there two conditional functions?" confusion and makes code intent clearer. Developers coming from other languages will immediately understand: `when` = optional single branch, `if` = mandatory both branches.
- **Paren type for immediate evaluation**: Viro includes paren `(...)` as a distinct type from block `[...]`. Blocks evaluate to themselves (deferred evaluation - data or code storage), while parens evaluate their contents immediately and return the result. This distinction is critical for: (1) overriding operator precedence `x: 3 + 4 * 2` vs `x: (3 + 4) * 2`, (2) dynamic path indices `array.(index + 1)`, (3) forcing evaluation in literal contexts `data: [name "Alice" age (current-year - birth-year)]`, and (4) computed refinement names `func (get refinement-word)`. Most expressions don't need parens—they evaluate naturally. Parens are only required when you need immediate evaluation in a deferred context (inside blocks) or to override precedence. Without parens, users would need verbose `do` calls for these cases: `data: [age do [current-year - birth-year]]`. Paren provides REBOL's elegant immediate-evaluation syntax while keeping blocks as pure data/code containers.
- **Traditional operator precedence**: Viro diverges from REBOL's strict left-to-right evaluation and implements **traditional mathematical operator precedence** (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, comparisons before equality, logical AND before OR). This critical design decision prevents user confusion: `3 + 4 * 2` evaluates to `11` (not 14), matching mathematical conventions and mainstream languages (C, JavaScript, Python, Java). REBOL's left-to-right approach is elegant for homoiconic purity but violates deep-rooted mathematical intuitions. The parser must build an AST respecting 7 precedence levels (see contracts/math.md), adding implementation complexity but dramatically improving usability. Users can still override precedence with parentheses: `(3 + 4) * 2` = 14.
- **Integer-only arithmetic (Phase 1 scope)**: Viro implements **64-bit signed integer arithmetic only** in Phase 1, deferring decimal/floating-point types to Phase 2. This reduces initial implementation complexity and allows focus on proving the core architecture: type-based dispatch, stack/frame management, native function evaluation, and parser with operator precedence. Decimal types introduce multiple design questions that are better addressed after core architecture is validated: (1) precision - float32 or float64?, (2) type coercion - should `3 + 4.5` be allowed and what's the result type?, (3) division semantics - should `5 / 2` return 2 (integer) or 2.5 (decimal)?, (4) special values - how to handle NaN, Infinity, -Infinity?, (5) string formatting - decimal places, scientific notation. Phase 1 uses truncating integer division: `10 / 3` → `3`, `-10 / 3` → `-3` (toward zero). Users needing decimal arithmetic can revisit this design in Phase 2 with full consideration of precision, coercion, and special value semantics.

**Next**: Phase 1 - Design & Contracts

- `contracts/error-handling.md`: Error structure, categories (0-900), construction, propagation
- `quickstart.md`: Build, run, test instructions with REPL examples and development workflow

**Agent Context**:
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with Go 1.21+, chzyer/readline, testing strategy

**Next**: Phase 2 - Task Breakdown (via `/speckit.tasks` command)

---

## Phase 2: Re-evaluation of Constitution Check

*Re-check after Phase 1 design to ensure no violations introduced*

✅ **Principle I - TDD**: Contracts define test cases before implementation. Quickstart documents TDD workflow.

✅ **Principle II - Incremental Layering**: Data model and contracts organized by architecture layer (Core → Types → Natives → Frames → Errors).

✅ **Principle III - Type Dispatch Fidelity**: Data model defines Value type with type tag and type-based dispatch via evaluator.

✅ **Principle IV - Stack and Frame Safety**: Data model specifies index-based access for Stack and Frame, avoiding pointer invalidation.

✅ **Principle V - Structured Errors**: Error contracts define 7 categories (0-900) with required fields (code, type, id, args, near, where).

✅ **Principle VI - Observable Behavior**: Print/input natives provide I/O. Error messages include near/where context per contracts.

✅ **Principle VII - YAGNI**: Contracts cover 28 natives (minimal set), parse dialect and advanced features deferred per spec out-of-scope.

**Gate Status**: ✅ PASSED - All constitutional requirements remain satisfied after design phase.
