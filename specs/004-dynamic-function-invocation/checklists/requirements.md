# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic Function Invocation (Action Types)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on user-facing behavior (polymorphic dispatch, type-safe operations) without mentioning specific Go implementation details. Technical terms like "action!" and "type frames" are used as conceptual entities, not as implementation directives.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   - All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 can be tested by invoking an action and verifying correct type-specific function executes)
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (100% of series functions, specific error message content)
   - Success criteria avoid implementation specifics (e.g., SC-002 focuses on user experience, not internal dispatch mechanism)
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with concrete examples
   - Edge cases cover boundary conditions (zero arguments, shadowing, refinements, runtime modifications)
   - Scope clearly bounded by "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies and assumptions explicitly listed

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - Three prioritized user stories cover: core dispatch (P1), extensibility (P2), error handling (P3)
   - Measurable outcomes align with user stories and requirements
   - Specification maintains abstraction layer appropriate for business stakeholders

## Notes

- The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- The suggested implementation approach (type frames + action! type) from the user is documented in the requirements but kept at a conceptual level
- No technical blockers identified
