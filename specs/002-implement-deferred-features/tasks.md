# Tasks: Deferred Language Capabilities (002)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-implement-deferred-features/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Decimal arithmetic - can start after Foundation
  - User Story 2 (P2): Ports - can start after Foundation (independent of US1)
  - User Story 3 (P3): Objects/Paths - can start after Foundation (independent of US1, US2)
  - User Story 4 (P4): Parse/Series - depends on US3 for object construction integration
  - User Story 5 (P5): Trace/Debug - can start after Foundation but should wait for US1-US4 for meaningful testing
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí No other dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí Independent (may use US1 decimals in examples but not required)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí Independent
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí Soft dependency on US3 for parse-to-object workflows
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí Soft dependency on US1-US4 for representative trace coverage

### Within Each User Story

- Contract tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Value type definitions before natives
- Parser updates before evaluation logic
- Core natives before convenience wrappers
- Error mappings before integration tests
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities Within Phases

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003-T009 can all run in parallel (different test files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 
- T011-T014 can run in parallel (different value structs)
- T016-T018 can run in parallel (different CLI flags)
- T020-T023 can run in parallel (different trace/debug components)

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T026-T032 contract tests can run in parallel (different test functions)
- T033-T034 parser tasks sequential (same file)
- T038-T043 math natives can run in parallel (different functions, may be same file but independent)
- T045 parallel with T042-T043 (different rounding helpers)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T052-T059 contract tests can run in parallel
- T061-T062 drivers can run in parallel (independent implementations)
- T066-T072 port natives can run in parallel if in separate functions
- T077-T079 integration tests can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:
- T080-T086 contract tests can run in parallel
- T089 parallel with T088 (context vs object, may share logic but independent)
- T093-T094 natives can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (User Story 4)**:
- T100-T110 contract tests can run in parallel
- T111-T115 series natives can run in parallel
- T118-T122 parse components sequential (depend on dialect.go structure)

**Phase 7 (User Story 5)**:
- T131-T140 contract tests can run in parallel
- T144-T146 trace natives can run in parallel
- T148-T152 debug commands can run in parallel (may share debugger state but independent functions)
- T155-T160 reflection natives can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- T168-T172 documentation can run in parallel
- T173-T177 integration tests can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Decimal Math)

```bash
# Launch all contract tests for decimal math together:
Task T026: "Contract test: decimal constructor in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"
Task T027: "Contract test: decimal promotion in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"
Task T028: "Contract test: pow, sqrt, exp domain validation in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"
Task T029: "Contract test: log, log-10 domain errors in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"
Task T030: "Contract test: trig functions in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"
Task T031: "Contract test: rounding modes in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"
Task T032: "Contract test: overflow/underflow handling in test/contract/math_decimal_test.go"

# After tests written and failing, launch parallel math native implementations:
Task T038: "Implement pow native in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
Task T039: "Implement sqrt native in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
Task T040: "Implement exp native in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
Task T041: "Implement log and log-10 natives in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
Task T042: "Implement trigonometric natives (sin, cos, tan) in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
Task T043: "Implement inverse trig natives (asin, acos, atan) in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
Task T045: "Implement ceil, floor, truncate natives in internal/native/math_decimal.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Decimal Arithmetic)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T025) **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T026-T051)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run SC-011 tests, verify precision and performance
5. Deploy/demo decimal arithmetic capability

**Rationale**: Decimal math is P1 priority and delivers immediate business value for financial calculations while having minimal dependencies on other features.

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Foundation**: Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T025) ‚Üí All value types and infrastructure ready
2. **MVP**: Add User Story 1 (T026-T051) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy decimal math ‚úÖ
3. **I/O Layer**: Add User Story 2 (T052-T079) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy ports and file/network I/O ‚úÖ
4. **Structured Data**: Add User Story 3 (T080-T099) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy objects and paths ‚úÖ
5. **Data Transformation**: Add User Story 4 (T100-T130) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy parse and series ‚úÖ
6. **Observability**: Add User Story 5 (T131-T167) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy trace/debug ‚úÖ
7. **Polish**: Complete Phase 8 (T168-T182) ‚Üí Full Feature 002 release

Each user story adds value without breaking previous stories. After each story, the interpreter remains in a deployable state.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers available:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T025)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Decimal Math) - T026-T051
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Ports) - T052-T079
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Objects) - T080-T099
3. **Week 4**: 
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Parse) - T100-T130 (needs US3 complete)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Trace/Debug) - T131-T167 (needs US1-US4 for testing)
4. **Week 5**: All developers collaborate on Phase 8 (Polish) - T168-T182

Stories US1, US2, US3 are fully independent and can proceed in parallel. US4 and US5 have soft dependencies but can overlap significantly with careful coordination.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story delivers independently testable increment
- Contract tests written first following TDD principles
- All port operations enforce sandbox root from CLI flag --sandbox-root
- Decimal precision target: 34 digits (decimal128), ‚â§1.5√ó integer performance
- Parse dialect follows REBOL 3 semantics where practical
- Trace logs rotate at 50 MB per file (5 backups) per clarification
- HTTP ports follow redirects automatically (max 10 hops) per clarification
- TLS verification required by default, --insecure flag available per research decision
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Run quickstart validation after each user story phase
- Constitution compliance verified in Phase 8 before release
